## Overview

The Stew backend serves as the foundation for the Stew application, providing essential functionalities such as user authentication, data storage, real-time communication, task management, and a doubt resolution feature using generative AI.

## Features

### User Authentication
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure user registration and login, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources.

### Timetable Management
- Create, read, update, and delete study timetables, allowing users to manage their study schedules effectively.

### Group Management
- Create and manage study groups, including functionalities for adding members, sending messages, and sharing files.

### Task Management
- Create, read, update, complete, and delete tasks.
- View scores related to task completion.

### Doubt Resolution
- Ask questions and receive answers generated by a generative AI model.
- Store and retrieve the history of questions and answers.

### Flashcards
- Create, update, and delete flashcards to help users reinforce their learning and improve retention.

### Data Visualization
- Provide endpoints to fetch user progress and scores, enabling the frontend to visualize data effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite for local development (can be extended to other databases like PostgreSQL for production)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO (if applicable)
- **Data Validation**: Marshmallow or Flask-SQLAlchemy for data serialization and validation
- **Generative AI**: Google Gemini for generating answers to doubts

## Installation

To set up the Stew backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. **Open Your Browser**:
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
